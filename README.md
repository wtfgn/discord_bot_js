### Set up the config files
You may modify the `config/config.json` as you wish. However, please do not modify anything in the `config/sv_config.json`, unless there is a new card pack released or you want to restrict the filter condition.

### Download FFMPEG to your machine
Please install FFMPEG to your machine locally, it is **NOT** recommended to use **`ffmpeg-static`** or anything similar, since they are not stable and may possibly cause some unexpected problems.
> Use `FFMPEG_PATH` environment variable to load ffmpeg from custom path if necessary.
